# Portfolio3rdIT

After making it two thirds of the way through my Full Stack program, and having knocked out a couple OOP and MVC projects, I thought it was time to update my portfolio. 
There are a couple of tweaks I will work on to get this perfected:

1. Add some CSS effects on the Project Page
2. Add a form to the Contact page
3. Tweak the color scheme
4. Add JS effects for more seemless link navigation
5. Replace JQuery with REACT templating.

Any suggestions to build on this would be appreciated.
